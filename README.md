# Onitama

## WELCOME

Welcome to Onitama!
Published by **Arcane Wonders** in 2014, and designed by **Shimpei Sato**, Onitama is a delightful strategy game loosely related to Chess.

Players move their pawns using cards that they pass back and forth as they play. Once someone captures their opponent's sage, or moves their own sage to their opponent's temple, they win!

### Purpose

I created this project during my time as a student at General Assembly, for the SOLE PURPOSE of honing my skills and demonstrating those skills to the programming industry.

**I do not in any way profit from this game**, or any links included in the game, beyond gaining the interest of potential employers or collaborators. I also include links to the publisher's official site, for those who are interested in purchasing a copy, which I will do again here: [Arcane Wonders](hhttps://www.arcanewonders.com/product/onitama/)

### Documentation

The pages with a high line-count have **MENUS** that you can open to help you find your way around. You'll find a few js pages with callback functions for different aspects of the program:
**eventHandlers.js** - functions that help handle events
**movement.js** - functions related to pawns and squares
**movementCards.js** - functions that help the movement cards work!

In the **ASSETS** folder, you'll find all images used on the site, plus a few alternate images. All image sources are attributed in the **FOOTER** on the **index.html**

### Thank You!

Have fun with Onitama! I had a wonderful time programming this game, and it will always hold a special place in my heart. If you're interested in collaborating, or just finding out what I'm up to these days, you can find me here on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-papac-738a99217/)
