                <h3>Onitama Rules:</h3>
                <p>Onitama was designed by Shimpei Sato and published by Arcane Wonders in 2014.
                   Related to chess, Onitama gives players a wonderfully unique experience. Any pawn can be moved, as long as it follows the rules of one of your movement cards! You rotate cards with your opponent, so be careful as you move.</p>
                <h3>There are two ways to win:</h3>
                <li>Way of Stone: Capture the opponent's Sage. </li>
                 <li>Way of Water: Move your Sage to your opponent's temple. </li>
                <p>Each turn, choose one of the movement cards available to you, then select a pawn. You can always choose a new pawn, or switch movement cards and consider your pawns again, before choosing a
                    highlighted square to move.</p>
                <p>Capture an enemy by moving one of your pawns, or your Sage, onto its square.</p>
                <p>This game is free to play, but if you love it, you can buy a copy of the game on the 
                    <a href="https://www.arcanewonders.com/product/onitama/">Arcane Wonders Website</a> or anywhere online. I don't get a commission,
